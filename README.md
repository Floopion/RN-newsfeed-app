# How to run the application

Requirements:
-	Node.js LTS release
-	Git
-	Watchman for macOS users
Install these requirements if you plan on developing in expo. Once those requirements are installed open the node.js command prompt and type “npm install –global expo-cli”. You now have expo installed on your PC.

After cloning the repository to set up the environment for development you have to open the node.js command prompt. Navigate into the folder of the cloned repository. Once you are in the cloned folder just type “expo start” and it will start up.
If it throws and error you should run in the command line these commands: "npm install axios" and "npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs"
